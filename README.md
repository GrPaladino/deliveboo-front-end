# Boolivery is a food delivery platform developed using Vue.js. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- Homepage:

  - Users land on the homepage, where they see a list of registered restaurants.
  - These restaurants are fetched from a database using an Axios call.
  - Users can filter the restaurants based on their preferences.

- Restaurant Pages:

  - When users click on a specific restaurant, they are taken to its dedicated page. Here, they can:
    - View the restaurantâ€™s menu.
    - Add desired dishes to their cart.
    - The cart is responsive and remains in memory even if the browser is closed.

- Checkout Process: - After selecting items, users proceed to checkout.
  If the entered data (such as delivery address and payment details) is correct, both the user and the restaurant receive an order confirmation via email.

In summary, Boolivery streamlines the food ordering process by allowing customers to explore menus, customize orders, and receive timely confirmations. Itâ€™s a convenient way to enjoy meals from the comfort of home! ðŸ˜Š
